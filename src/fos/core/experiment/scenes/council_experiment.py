"""
Council experiment scene for multi-round deliberation and voting.

Extends ExperimentScene to provide round-based execution with automatic
multi-round context management for council deliberations. This migration
fixes BUG-CTX-01 where agents did not receive prior-round context.

Key features:
- Round tracking via experiment runner (not manual)
- Multi-round deliberation context via RoundContextManager
- Phase-based action filtering via SystemFacilitator
