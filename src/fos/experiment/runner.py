"""
Checkpointed execution layer around the FOS council machinery.

This is the Phase 4 Step 2 checkpoint layer. It owns the run queue, the
state database, per-round checkpoints, resume, status, and result
collection — and delegates deliberation, prompts, neighbour context, and
voting to the real FOS council scene (src/fos/core/experiment/). It never
touches anything inside FOS; it calls tree.advance(turns=1) once per round
and reads the finished node afterwards.

For each run the layer: rebuilds and verifies the network, loads the
population, places agents and confederates deterministically (sha256 seeds,
never hash()), drives four FOS rounds one at a time with a checkpoint after
every round, extracts results from the finished node, applies the
empty-response gate (>5% empty LLM calls fails the run) and the validation
gates, and writes the result file atomically.

Functions:
    run()                 — execute pending runs (or one specific run)
    retry()               — reset failed runs back to pending
    request_interrupt()   — ask the current run to stop at the next round boundary
    _execute_one_run()    — full pipeline for one run, resuming when possible
    _check_interrupted()  — raise RunInterrupted when SIGINT arrived
    _matrix_row()         — one row of the run matrix CSV
    _load_population()    — load and sha256-verify a population file
    _proposal_statement() — statement text for a proposal id
    _write_checkpoint()   — persist the tree + placement + call history
    _load_checkpoint()    — read a checkpoint back for resume
