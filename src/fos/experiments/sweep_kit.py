"""
Sweep and diagnostic runners for the Gui & Toubia (2025) unblinding study.

This module is the executable layer that sits on top of
fos.experiments.randomization. It builds the survey prompts from the paper,
runs them against an injected chat function (so tests never touch a network),
and writes self-describing results. It contains no network code of its own.

What each function does:
    build_blinded_system_prompt()          - The paper Prompt 2/10 system
                                             line: the model plays a customer
                                             and fills in the blanks.
    build_unblinded_system_prompt(design)  - The Prompt-6 system prompt: the
                                             fill task plus the design's
                                             unblinding paragraph. For a
                                             blinded design it is exactly the
                                             Prompt-2/10 prompt.
    build_purchase_user_prompt(...)        - The Prompt-2 purchase survey shown
                                             to the customer (buy or not buy).
    build_covariate_fillin_prompt(...)     - One Prompt 1/7/8 probe that asks
                                             the model to fill in a covariate
                                             (past price, competing price,
                                             expiry days, or household income)
                                             at a given price.
    parse_purchase(text)                   - Reads the model's one-line answer:
                                             True for "purchase"/"yes", False
                                             for "not purchase"/"no", None
                                             otherwise.
    parse_fillin_number(text)              - Reads a "$8.26"-style answer as a
                                             float, or None for garbage.
    _first_answer_line(text)              - First line of an answer after
                                             wrapper stripping, spans turned
                                             into single spaces.
    _first_line_has_token_span(text)      - True when a <|...|> span sits on
                                             the answer's first line (tells
                                             the parser a span made the word
                                             boundary).
    _strip_channel_wrappers(text)          - Removes the llama-server
                                             reasoning-channel marker that some
                                             models wrap around their answer.
    aggregate_demand(records, levels)      - Turns sweep records into one
                                             {level, p_buy, n} bucket per price
                                             level, sorted low to high.
    build_record(...)                      - One self-describing result row for
                                             a single chat call.
    run_sweep(...)                         - Runs the full demand sweep
                                             (products x levels x draws) under
                                             one blinding condition.
    run_persona_sweep(...)                 - Persona sweep: one chat call per
                                             (product x level x persona) at
                                             temperature 0.0, rendering the
                                             persona block into the prompt.
    run_diagnostic(...)                    - Runs the confounding diagnostic
                                             (products x levels x covariate
                                             kinds x draws) under one blinding
                                             condition.
    summarize_confounding(records, design) - Summarizes covariate confounding
                                             per kind, mirroring
                                             randomization.check_confounding.
    write_manifest(path, ...)              - Writes a JSON run manifest with a
                                             timestamp, never shelling out.
