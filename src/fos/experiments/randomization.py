"""
Randomization designs and sanity diagnostics for unblinded LLM experiments.

This module is the "experimental unblinding randomization kit" behind the
Gui & Toubia (2025) comparison. It holds:

- RandomizationDesign: a frozen record describing one treatment variable
  (its machine name, human label, support min/max, unit, distribution,
  number of grid points, blinding setting, seed, and the covariates the
  prompt specifies).
- RandomizationDesign.sample(rng): draw one treatment value.
- RandomizationDesign.grid(): build the fixed sweep of treatment values that
  diagnostics sweep over.
- RandomizationDesign.render_unblinding(): render the unblinding system-prompt
  paragraph (blinded designs render nothing).
- RandomizationDesign.to_json() / from_json(): store and rebuild a design.
- spearman_with_ci: Spearman rank correlation with a bootstrap confidence
  interval (never a p-value).
- check_confounding: does a covariate leak the treatment level?
- check_monotonicity: does the outcome curve follow the expected direction?
- check_step_function: does the outcome jump at one level (focalism)?
- check_non_response: does the outcome ignore the treatment entirely?
- count_specified_covariates: heuristic count of key: value persona pairs.
- lint_covariate_count: warn/flag tiers for too many specified covariates.
