# RED-phase tests (TASK-1500) for the Appendix E measured-covariate stage
# machinery - RENDER format and real-dataset integration. A stage profile is
# ONE resampled Twin-2K-500 respondent row, kept whole so joint dependence
# survives; every rendered score and percentile is that row's measured value
# and the panel's empirical percentile - nothing model-invented, nothing
# invalid, ever. The block text follows Prompt 12 verbatim (RESULT-1474 §1):
# a "# Demographics:" bullet block first, then the measure block of every
# stage <= the requested stage in Table E.1 order, each "# ..." header with
# its "<note: ...>" scale/range line and, where the prompt prints them
# inline, the "{score} ({pct} percentile)" suffix.
#
# TestRenderPrompt12Format   - exact Prompt-12 line grammar on the fixture
#     panel (canonical stage-3 block pinned line by line), cumulative block
#     coverage, note scale/range texts, wave-1 conscientiousness, and
#     score/percentile consistency between profile and render.
# TestRealTwinDataset        - skip-guarded: loads the real 2,058-row panel
#     from /home/justin/work/datasets/Twin-2K-500, pins the documented pool
#     sizes after cleaning, and renders a 50-profile sample across all 12
#     stages with zero invalid values (RED until the loader exists).
