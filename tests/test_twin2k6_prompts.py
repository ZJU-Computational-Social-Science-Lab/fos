# Locked tests for the twin2k6 study's prompt builders (TASK-2060 RED
# phase; tests ONLY — no implementation lives here yet).
#
# WHAT THIS FILE CHECKS, in plain words:
#   - The blinded system prompt is exactly one short line.
#   - The unblinded system prompt is the blinded line, then the pinned
#     randomization paragraph (which must never say "uniform" or "equal
#     probability"), then a numbered list of EVERY version of that
#     experiment with its complete verbatim question text.
#   - The user prompt is byte-identical to the R1 demographics format:
#     the EMBODY THIS PERSON block with exactly the 11 demographic fields,
#     a blank line, the verbatim question, a blank line, the lettered
#     options in display order, a blank line, and the pinned final
#     instruction. It never mentions QIDs, never leaks another
#     experiment's question, and never carries behavioural-measure keys.
#
# All offline: pure string building plus reads of the shipped data file.
