### 1.3 Platform Overview

This platform is an online social simulation tool that requires no client download or installation - it can be accessed directly through a browser. Core features include simulation scene creation, agent configuration, simulation execution and observation, template management, data export, and AI analysis, meeting various social simulation experiment needs.

## 2. Preparation

### 2.1 Environment Requirements (Online Platform Adaptation)

To ensure normal platform operation, the following browser and device requirements must be met. No additional software installation is required:

- **Browser**: Google Chrome 100.0+ or Microsoft Edge 100.0+ are recommended. IE browser is not recommended (may cause functional issues).
- **Device**: Desktop computer, laptop, or tablet. Computer operation is preferred (better convenience and compatibility).
- **Network**: A stable internet connection is required (wired or wireless). Avoid network interruptions during operation.

### 2.2 Account and Access Preparation

Account registration must be completed before accessing the platform: After entering the platform's official access address, click the "Register" button, fill in the organization, email, username and other information as prompted, set your personal account password, and complete registration to obtain access permissions.

**Special Note**: This project does not currently support password recovery. Please remember your account and password carefully to avoid being unable to log in due to a forgotten password.

## 8. Notes and Operation Standards

1. Do not open multiple identical operation pages simultaneously to avoid data conflicts and operation failures;
2. During critical operations such as simulation running and data import/export, ensure network stability. Do not close or refresh the page midway;
3. Properly safeguard platform simulation data and operation records. Export and backup important data in time;
4. Strictly follow platform usage standards. Do not upload or publish irrelevant content. Violations may result in restricted account permissions;
5. After use, click "Sign Out" in the upper right corner of the homepage. This is especially important on public computers to ensure account security;
6. When conducting targeted experiments such as "Meaning Decay in Policy Communication", plan agent distribution and initial values in advance to improve simulation accuracy;
