# This file builds the exact texts the models are shown. The system prompt
# is one short line normally, or that line plus a fixed note plus the full
# list of every version of the experiment when the model is told the setup
# was randomized ("unblinded"). Every ANSWER is measured with one
# deterministic first-token call, so each item gets its OWN user prompt
# (build_user_prompt with item=): the "EMBODY THIS PERSON" block with the
# 11 demographic fields, then that one item — a choice question with its
# lettered options, or one rating statement (or one numeric estimate
# question) with its "N = label" answer scale — then one closing
# instruction: a letter answer, or a single number. Whole-arm rendering
# (item=None) still exists for the choice-only arms whose single item IS
# the arm; an arm holding digit items has no single prompt and refuses to
# render one. Nothing here ever mentions question ids or the banned words
# "uniform" / "equal probability"; blinding lives only in the system
# prompt.
