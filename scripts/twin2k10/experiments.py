# This file is the twin2k10 study's experiment register: it lists the ten
# Twin2K survey experiments, and for each one the experimental versions
# (arms) with the question ids that belong to each arm. Nine experiments
# are between-subjects with two arms; false_consensus is the one
# within-subject experiment (a single "all" arm whose question has 10
# rows). The two anchoring experiments are special: each of their arms
# carries TWO questions — the more/less anchor choice first, then the
# numeric estimate — so one anchoring record holds both a first-token
# letter scoring and K numeric samples. The file also loads the shipped
# survey-question file so prompts and scoring always read the exact same
# question texts.
