# This file writes the study's text outputs: the full model roster (so the
# reader can check nothing was silently dropped) and the one-page SUMMARY
# file. Every number in the summary is looked up from the tables the
# pipeline just computed — nothing is invented here. Its functions:
#   roster_text — one line per model: family, architecture, parameters,
#     measurement method, answer-file legs and how many cells were found;
#   prior_art_deltas — compare our gain numbers with the earlier published
#     table and report any difference larger than 0.05;
#   summary_text — the one-page SUMMARY-V2.md answering the four study
#     questions, conservatively, with associations only (no causes).

Purchase probability by price (40 grocery products, 20-200% of regular price; 16 models; human
reference: 40x10 primary cells, source: {human_source}). G = model price slope / human price
slope (G=1 human-like, G=0 flat). These are descriptive associations from observational model
comparisons — no causal claims; counts only, no statistical tests.

**1. Is price response related to active parameter count?** Weakly at best. Unblinded G spans
{known['G_lin'].min():.2f}-{known['G_lin'].max():.2f} across {len(known)} models with known active
params; the top gainers are {top3}. Both the smallest (qwen3-4b, 4B active, G=
{float(known.loc[known['model_id'] == 'qwen3-4b', 'G_lin'].iloc[0]):.2f}) and the largest dense
models (~31-33B active) include flat and human-like curves, so active scale alone does not order
the models.

**2. Dense vs MoE at approximate scale control?** In the ~3-4B active band MoE models span
G {moe.min():.2f}-{moe.max():.2f} vs dense qwen3-4b G
{float(known.loc[known['model_id'] == 'qwen3-4b', 'G_lin'].iloc[0]):.2f}; in the ~27-33B band the
measured models are almost all dense. No consistent dense-vs-MoE direction:
MoE range {moe.min():.2f}-{moe.max():.2f} vs dense range {dense.min():.2f}-{dense.max():.2f}
(unblinded, known-active models).

**3. Important exceptions?**
- {swing}: the largest blinding swing among models with full 400-cell coverage in both
  conditions (blinded vs unblinded G).
- Gemma-4-26B-A4B also swings widely: blinded G={_fmt(table.loc[(table.model_id == 'gemma-4-26b-a4b') & (table.condition == BLINDED), 'G_lin'].iloc[0])}
  vs unblinded G={_fmt(table.loc[(table.model_id == 'gemma-4-26b-a4b') & (table.condition == UNBLINDED), 'G_lin'].iloc[0])}
  (B moves { _fmt(table.loc[(table.model_id == 'gemma-4-26b-a4b') & (table.condition == BLINDED), 'B_pp'].iloc[0], 1)} -> {_fmt(table.loc[(table.model_id == 'gemma-4-26b-a4b') & (table.condition == UNBLINDED), 'B_pp'].iloc[0], 1)} pp).
- Qwen3.8-Max: forced-choice API measure, partial legs ({int(table.loc[(table.model_id == 'qwen3.8-max-0902') & (table.condition == UNBLINDED), 'n_cells'].iloc[0])} unblinded primary cells of 400;
  11-35 products only) — treat its G={_fmt(table.loc[(table.model_id == 'qwen3.8-max-0902') & (table.condition == UNBLINDED), 'G_lin'].iloc[0])} as indicative.
- Gemma-4-31B: unblinded leg rebuilt to {g31_unb_cells}/400 primary cells via the documented
  sidecar repair of the frozen run's retry damage ({g31_unb_records} valid readings; backfilled
  cells carry legacy nulls, excluded from means; 13 primary cells are null in every surviving
  source — frozen file, pre-retry backup and retry snapshot — so no reading exists for them);
  blinded stays partial: {g31_bld_cells}/400 ({g31_bld_records} records) primary cells — its
  G values are computed from the cells that exist.
- Community fine-tune qwen3.6-35b-UC tracks its base model only loosely
  (G {_fmt(table.loc[(table.model_id == 'qwen3.6-35b-a3b-uncensored') & (table.condition == UNBLINDED), 'G_lin'].iloc[0])} vs
  {_fmt(table.loc[(table.model_id == 'qwen3.6-35b-a3b') & (table.condition == UNBLINDED), 'G_lin'].iloc[0])} for the official base).

**4. Does the pattern replicate across families?** Within-family generation trends
(unblinded G):
{chr(10).join(_family_trend_lines(table))}
Qwen rises from Qwen3 to Qwen3.6 then varies; Gemma rises with size but its 26B-A4B MoE sits far
above its own 12B dense; Granite splits by size: near-flat at 8B, above-human at 30B. The pattern is therefore
family-specific as much as scale-related.

**Probability measure per model**
{chr(10).join(method_lines)}

**Gemma-4-31B provenance.** Run `R1-YESNO-GEMMA31B-20260917T120236` (the only complete
Gemma-4-31B run; the 055107 dir is empty, the 231219 dir a 5% stub). A 2026-09-18 in-place retry
repaired the failed yes/no readings but dropped 25 of 440 cells and double-wrote 1,198 persona
slots; the unblinded leg was therefore rebuilt into a sidecar — one row per product-price-persona,
frozen-file reading wins, cells only present in the pre-retry backup are backfilled, backup nulls
stay null and are excluded from cell means (see the sidecar's .provenance.md) — and the registry
reads that leg from the sidecar; the frozen run dir is untouched. 13 primary cells (260 persona
slots) have no usable reading in any surviving source — frozen file, pre-retry backup and retry
snapshot — so the sidecar cannot restore them. The blinded leg still comes from the frozen run
dir and stays partial: {g31_bld_cells}/400 primary cells ({g31_bld_records}
records). Its computed blinded G is {g31_bld_g:.2f} from {g31_bld_cells} cells and
unblinded G={g31_unb_g:.2f} from {g31_unb_cells} cells — far from 0 as required.

**Coverage anomalies.**
{chr(10).join(f'- {row.model_id} {row.condition}: {row.primary_cells}/400 primary cells ({row.records} records)' for row in partial.itertuples()) or '- none: all demographics legs cover the 400 primary cells.'}

**Sanity vs published prior art** (`bias_gain_shape_stats.csv`, same cells source):
{chr(10).join(deltas)}
Published r/rmse values there were computed on per-price means, so V2 pearson_r/rmse_pp (cell-level)
are expected to differ; G/B are compared directly.
