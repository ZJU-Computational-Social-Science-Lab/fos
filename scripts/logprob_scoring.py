"""Read the model's own purchase probability from llama-server logprobs.

R1LP is the logprob version of the 5-model experiment: instead of sampling
many grammar-constrained draws, it asks the model once per prompt for the
probability it assigns to "purchase" versus "not purchase", with no
grammar. This module owns the two scoring mechanisms and every parsing and
arithmetic step they need. It never starts a run and never loads a model;
the HTTP call is an injectable `post` function so every test can run fully
offline against a fake transport.

The two mechanisms (chosen with --logprob-mode):
    first_token - ONE call per prompt: POST /v1/chat/completions
        with a short max_tokens window (the decision scan),
        temperature=1.0, logprobs=true, top_logprobs=20. The parser walks
        the generated tokens, SKIPS control/channel tokens and reads the
        top-logprobs at the FIRST substantive answer position: p_buy
        (tokens that continue "purchase"), p_nobuy (tokens that start
        "not") and their sum branch_mass; a flag records when neither
        branch is in the top-k.
    candidate_scoring (default) - TWO calls per prompt (one per
        candidate): POST /completions with the chat-templated prompt plus
        the candidate
        appended, n_predict=0, logprobs=true, n_probs=20, temperature=1.0.
        The candidate's own token logprobs are summed (lp_sum), counted and
        length-normalized (lp_mean); a 2-way softmax turns the two
        candidates' scores into p_buy / p_nobuy (plus a length-normalized
        variant).

The exact llama-server response shape of /completions is still an open
item: it must be validated with a 2-4 call probe before the real run (see
LOGPROB-DESIGN.md). The parser below therefore tolerates the known
variants (completion_probabilities, prompt_logprobs, per-token
top_logprobs/probs) and always keeps a truncated raw response for audit.

Plain-language function map:
    purchase_branch_mass(...)     - p_buy / p_nobuy / branch_mass from a
                                    top-logprobs list (fold forms decide
                                    which token spellings count).
    parse_first_token_response()  - the decision position and top-logprobs
                                    out of one /v1/chat/completions reply
                                    (control/channel chosen tokens are
                                    skipped, whole control SEQUENCES are
                                    consumed as one block; the first
                                    substantive answer position is
                                    measured and flagged when its yes/no
                                    coverage is low).
    parse_candidate_response()    - per-token logprobs out of one
                                    /completions reply (all variants).
    sum_candidate_logprobs(...)   - lp_sum / lp_tokens / lp_mean for the
                                    trailing candidate tokens.
    candidate_softmax(...)        - 2-way softmax of the two candidates.
    count_candidate_tokens(...)   - how many trailing tokens a candidate is.
    render_chat_template(...)     - a ChatML rendering of the chat messages.
    make_first_token_scorer(...)  - the first_token scorer.
    make_candidate_scorer(...)    - the candidate_scoring scorer; stamps
                                    the label_order it scored on every
                                    result.
    average_ab_p_buy(...)         - the A/B aggregate: the mean of the two
                                    label orders' p(buy) values.
    make_ab_scorer(...)           - the A/B executor: scores BOTH label
                                    orders per prompt and merges them into
                                    ONE result (averaged p(buy) plus both
                                    raw per-order results under their
                                    label_order stamps).
    make_scorer(...)              - pick one by mode name (ab_orders=True
                                    wraps candidate_scoring in the A/B
                                    executor).

    A/B form, so that combination refuses loudly instead of silently
    scoring one order. labels threads the answer words (from the run's
    response_format) into the first_token branch matcher. scan_tokens is
    the first_token decision-scan window (the request's max_tokens; the
    production default of 8 walks past control-token prefixes),
    control_tokens/control_sequences extend the skipped control spec per
    model (single tokens, or whole exact sequences consumed as one
    block), top_k is the request's candidate coverage (payload
    top_logprobs, default 20), fold_forms replaces the conservative
    default fold list, and branch_mass_threshold sets the
    low_branch_mass flag point - all only apply to first_token
