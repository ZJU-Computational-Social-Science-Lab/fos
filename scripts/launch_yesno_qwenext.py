"""The R1-YESNO-QWENEXT queue specification: three more Qwen models on
qwen3.8-27b's slice, planned and printed offline.

R1-YESNO-QWENEXT re-runs the R1-YESNO first-token yes/no logprob
experiment with three additional Qwen models. Every one of the three
answers the SAME persona slice that qwen/qwen3.8-27b (queue index 2 in
launch_queue.MODEL_QUEUE) answered in R1-YESNO - pool personas [40, 60)
of every product's 100-persona pool - so the new models are directly
comparable to qwen3.8-27b (a shared slice, NOT a partition of the pool).
The geometry is the R1-YESNO geometry exactly: one scoring pass per
prompt, so per model 2 x 40 x 11 x 1 = 880 bare + 2 x 40 x 20 x 11 =
17,600 demographics = 18,480 calls, and the three models together
55,440 across 12 legs. None of the three models has a top-k or
control-sequence override (qwen3.8-27b needed none; the record flags
surface any surprise at analysis time), and the pools are reused from
the same archived run as every other profile. Like launch_queue.py this
module is a pure specification: it opens no sockets and writes no files;
the network only runs inside the runner's run paths.

The GLM companion run (R1-YESNO-QWENEXT-GLM) is the same study for one
more model: glm/glm-4.7-flash answers the SAME shared [40, 60) slice
with the identical geometry, as its own run dir (own profile stamp) that
analysis merges with the 3-model run. It reuses everything here - only
the model queue and the profile stamp differ, chosen per plan build.

The local dense companion run (R1-YESNO-QWEN36D) is the same study again
for one more model: qwen/qwen3.6-27b-dense (the brand-new dense 27B GGUF
served by the local model manager) answers the SAME shared [40, 60)
slice with the identical geometry, as its own run dir (own profile
stamp) that analysis merges with the 3-model run and the GLM companion.
It reuses everything here - only the model queue and the profile stamp
differ, chosen per plan build.

The local Gemma companion run (R1-YESNO-GEMMA31B) is the same study once
more: google/gemma-4-31b-it-qat (the Gemma-4-31B-it QAT Q4_0 GGUF served
by the local model manager) answers the SAME shared [40, 60) slice with
the identical geometry, as its own run dir (own profile stamp) that
analysis merges with the 3-model run and the GLM / QWEN36D companions.
It reuses everything here - only the model queue and the profile stamp
differ, chosen per plan build.

What each function does (plain language):
    qwenext_persona_slice(index)  - The shared [40, 60) slice every
                                    QWENEXT model answers (the exact
                                    slice qwen3.8-27b answered in
                                    R1-YESNO); refuses an index outside
                                    the queue instead of silently
                                    slicing empty.
    _qwenext_model_meta(...)      - The plan's summary of one model: its
                                    calls and its shared persona slice.
    build_qwenext_plan(...)       - The queue plan: 12 legs for the
                                    3-model queue (18,480 x 3 calls) or
                                    4 legs for a one-model companion
                                    (18,480; GLM, the local dense
                                    Qwen3.6-27B, or the local Gemma-
                                    4-31B); pass model_queue to pick
                                    the queue.
    print_qwenext_dry_run(...)    - The printed plan (dry run) - no
                                    manager, no server, no grammar.
