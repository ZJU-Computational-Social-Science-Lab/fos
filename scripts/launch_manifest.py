"""Run-level manifest for the launch wrapper: started marker, resume merge.

The run-level manifest of one launch run lives at <run_dir>/manifest.json
and is the record of the whole run: configuration, timestamps, the persona
pool summary, and one entry per (depth x blinding) leg. This module owns
that file and the rules that keep it coherent across several invocations of
the same run (a launch that was stopped and resumed):

  * The FIRST invocation writes the manifest as soon as the run starts with
    state "running" and no legs yet, so an interrupted run is recognised
    (the guard refuses a non-resume rerun into a directory that holds one)
    and the run's true start time survives every resume.
  * A terminal write (state "complete", "stopped_gracefully" or "stopped"
    for an operator stop, TASK-1525) merges: every planned leg appears
    exactly once, in plan order - legs finished in this invocation come from
    its results, legs finished in an earlier invocation whose run-level
    manifest never recorded them are read back from the leg's own files
    (_leg_done_result), and legs recorded as ok in the earlier manifest are
    carried forward. The earliest start is kept, each resume invocation is
    recorded under "resumed", and the pools summary is carried forward when
    the pool phase was skipped. Resuming a fully completed run therefore
    never wipes the manifest.
  * Legs are the unit of resume: a leg's records are written only when the
    whole leg completes (see launch_sweep), so "done" means its files and
    its own manifest exist (_leg_is_done), and a partial leg is re-run.

Function map:
    _run_dir_has_state(run_dir)  - Any durable sign of a launch attempt?
    _load_run_manifest(run_dir)  - The run-level manifest on disk, if any.
    _leg_done_result(...)        - One finished leg's summary, rebuilt from
                                   its own jsonl records.
    _build_run_payload(...)      - Assemble one coherent manifest payload.
    _write_run_manifest(...)     - Build the payload and write manifest.json.
