"""OpenRouter API layer for the Qwen3.8-Max grammar sweep (TASK-1654).

This module is the "phone line" half of the OpenRouter sweep harness: it
knows how to talk to https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions and how
to read what comes back, but it never decides WHAT to ask. The run half
(plan, legs, records, resume, CLI) lives in openrouter_max_sweep.py, which
re-exports everything defined here.

What each function / object does (plain language):
    SWEEP_PROFILE           - The run-family stamp put in every manifest.
    DEFAULT_MODEL           - The pinned OpenRouter model id (never the
                              bare alias).
    NONE_LEG_TEMPERATURE    - The plain-draw legs' temperature, taken from
                              the local sweep kit so they cannot drift.
    PERSONA_LEG_TEMPERATURE - The persona legs' temperature, ditto.
    DEFAULT_DRAWS           - Draws per (product x level) for the plan.
    PROMPT_USD_PER_M ...    - The dollar prices per million tokens used for
                              all cost accounting.
    DEFAULT_MAX_COST_USD    - The default spend cap (the harness refuses to
                              start a call that would push past it).
    DEFAULT_CONCURRENCY     - How many legs may run at once.
    MAX_TRIES               - The most times one call is attempted.
    DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS - Seconds one call may take before it is cut.
    DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS      - The answer-size cap: a truncation guard, not
                              a cost knob (only generated tokens bill).
    REASONING_SETTINGS      - Asks OpenRouter to switch the model's
                              thinking off; the sweep wants the forced
                              decision, not a chain of thought.
    OPENROUTER_URL          - The chat-completions endpoint.
    DEFAULT_POOLS_FROM      - The archived persona pools reused by default
                              (taken from launch_queue so it cannot drift).
    PERSONA_INDICES         - The four spread pool personas the demographics
                              legs embody, in draw order 0..3.
    DEFAULT_LEVELS          - The default 11-step price ladder (percent of
                              regular price).
    OpenRouterError         - One failed API exchange (HTTP status + the
                              server's message).
    build_response_format() - The exact strict JSON schema every request
                              must carry (the API stand-in for the local
                              one-token grammar).
    parse_decision(text)    - Reads the answer's JSON object: True for
                              "purchase", False for "not purchase", None
                              for anything unparsable or unmapped.
    decision_text(text)     - The answer's raw decision string, or None
                              when the text holds no JSON decision field.
    call_cost_usd(usage)    - One response's token usage priced at the
                              pinned per-million rates.
    subsample_personas(pool) - The four personas at PERSONA_INDICES, in
                              order; refuses a pool too short to hold them.
    make_openrouter_chat_fn(...) - Wraps a transport into the sweep kit's
                              chat function: builds the payload (pinned
                              schema attached), retries 429/5xx with
                              growing backoff, aborts loudly on a rejected
                              model id, and reports each answer's token
                              usage to on_usage.
    make_http_transport(...) - The real network transport: one POST per
                              call, key in the Authorization header only
                              (the key never enters logs or errors).

Importing this module never opens a socket; dialing happens only when a
transport built by make_http_transport is actually called.
